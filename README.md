# Firebase
#### F*ck a db.

-----
## What is it?

A hosted backend *'solution'* for web and mobile apps including
- a NoSQL database for storage and realtime syncing of your app's
      data
- built-in user authentication schemes via popular OAuth resource providers
- a secure, global CDN to host your app's static assets

-----
## Why is it important?

Firebase is especially valuable to developers of user-focused apps who want to
focus on UX, allowing devs to

- separate concerns
- build quickly
- scale quickly (i.e., immediately) 

Also, el Goog bought them... so it's, like, a big deal. [Who else is is using Firebase?](https://www.firebase.com/customers/)

-----
## How to use it?

#### Oh, let me count the ways...

Actually, I'll just show a couple of quick node examples.

```
    npm i --save firebase
```


-----
## Roadblocks

- running the examples on gh-pages

#### Why NOT use Firebase?

- did I mention it's now owned by el Goog?

If you want an open source solution, there are projects offering nice, simple,
backends as services, including:

- [hoodie](hood.ie)

Other potential roll-your-own solution components:

- [couchDB](couchdb.apache.org)
- [socketIO](socket.io)
- [express](expressjs.com)
